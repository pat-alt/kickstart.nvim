# kickstart.nvim

This is my personal Neovim config originally forked from [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Syncing Fork

Syncing can be a little annoying, because I've moved to a more modular structure. Still, for the time being, I'm trying to sync regularly. To do so:

1. Merge updates from [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) into the #updates-from-master branch. 
2. Resolve inevitable conflicts.
3. Merge into #main.
