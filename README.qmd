# kickstart.nvim

This is my personal Neovim config originally forked from [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). I've started using Neovim in 2025H1, so I'm still very new to this. For this reason, I'm including the following disclaimer here:

> [!WARNING]
> - I'm new to this.
> - You almost definitely do not want to fork this repo for your own config. 
> - I'm currently using this README mostly to jot down notes for myself. 

## Syncing Fork

Syncing can be a little annoying, because I've moved to a more modular structure. Still, for the time being, I'm trying to sync regularly. To do so:

1. Merge updates from [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) into the #updates-from-master branch. 
2. Resolve inevitable conflicts.
3. Merge into #main.

## Best Practices ... maybe

### Lazy 

- Use `opts` to specify config options. Use `config` only for more complex configurations. 


```{julia}
println("hello")
```
